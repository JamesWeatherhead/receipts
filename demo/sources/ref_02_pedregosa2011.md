## Abstract

Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised problems. This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists using a general-purpose high-level language. Emphasis is put on ease of use, performance, documentation, and API consistency.

## 1. Introduction

The scikit-learn project started in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by David Cournapeau. It has minimal dependencies and is distributed under the **simplified BSD license**, encouraging its use in both academic and commercial settings.

## 2. Project Vision

Scikit-learn aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems that are accessible to everybody. We favor a batteries-included approach: we rely on and require as few user-installed dependencies as possible.

## 3. Underlying Technologies

Scikit-learn is written primarily in Python, with some core algorithms implemented in Cython to achieve performance. It builds upon NumPy and SciPy.

## 4. Code Quality

The package is supported by a comprehensive user guide of **approximately 300 pages** including narrative documentation, class references, a tutorial, installation instructions, as well as **more than 60 examples**, some featuring real-world applications.

## 5. Authors

The authors of this paper number **16 contributors** total, representing institutions across France, Germany, and the United States.

## 6. Conclusion

Scikit-learn provides a simple and efficient solution for machine learning in Python, enabling both academic research and commercial applications through its permissive BSD license.
