## Citations Needing Adjustment

### Reference 1: Srivastava et al. (2014) - Dropout

**Status:** ADJUST

#### Issue 1: Dropout probability

**Claim in manuscript:**
> the optimal dropout probability is p=0.5 for all layers

**What source actually states:**
> All dropout nets use p=0.5 for hidden units and p=0.8 for input units.

**Discrepancy:** Manuscript oversimplifies - different rates for hidden vs input layers

**Required fix:** Change "p=0.5 for all layers" to "p=0.5 for hidden units and p=0.8 for input units"

---

#### Issue 2: MNIST error rate

**Claim in manuscript:**
> achieved an error rate of 0.89% on MNIST

**What source actually states:**
> Error rates can be further improved to 0.94%

**Discrepancy:** Wrong number (0.89% vs 0.94%)

**Required fix:** Change "0.89%" to "0.94%"

---

### Reference 2: Pedregosa et al. (2011) - Scikit-learn

**Status:** ADJUST

#### Issue 1: Language claim

**Claim in manuscript:**
> The library is written entirely in Python

**What source actually states:**
> Scikit-learn is written primarily in Python, with some core algorithms implemented in Cython

**Discrepancy:** "entirely" vs "primarily" - library uses Cython for performance

**Required fix:** Change "written entirely in Python" to "written primarily in Python"

---

#### Issue 2: Algorithm count

**Claim in manuscript:**
> includes implementations of over 100 algorithms

**What source actually states:**
> integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms

**Discrepancy:** The source does not specify a number - "over 100" is unsupported

**Required fix:** Remove specific number or cite a different source

---

#### Issue 3: Author count

**Claim in manuscript:**
> developed by a team of 12 authors

**What source actually states:**
> The authors of this paper number 16 contributors total

**Discrepancy:** Wrong count (12 vs 16)

**Required fix:** Change "12 authors" to "16 contributors"

---

#### Issue 4: License type

**Claim in manuscript:**
> distributed under the MIT license

**What source actually states:**
> distributed under the simplified BSD license

**Discrepancy:** Wrong license type (MIT vs BSD)

**Required fix:** Change "MIT license" to "BSD license"
