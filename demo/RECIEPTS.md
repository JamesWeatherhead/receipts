## ⚠️ Needs Adjustment

### Ref [1]: Srivastava et al. (2014) - Dropout

**STATUS: ⚠️ ADJUST**

#### Issue 1: Dropout probability claim

**Claim:** "the optimal dropout probability is p=0.5 for all layers"

**Source says:** "All dropout nets use p=0.5 for hidden units and p=0.8 for input units."

**Fix:** Change to "p=0.5 for hidden units and p=0.8 for input units"

#### Issue 2: MNIST error rate

**Claim:** "achieved an error rate of 0.89% on MNIST"

**Source says:** "Error rates can be further improved to 0.94%"

**Fix:** Change "0.89%" to "0.94%"

**STATUS: ⚠️ ADJUST**

#### Issue 1: Language claim

**Claim:** "written entirely in Python"

**Source says:** "written primarily in Python, with some core algorithms implemented in Cython"

**Fix:** Change to "written primarily in Python"

#### Issue 2: Algorithm count (UNSUPPORTED)

**Claim:** "over 100 algorithms"

**Source says:** "a wide range of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms" (no specific number)

**Fix:** Remove specific number or find another source

#### Issue 3: Author count

**Claim:** "12 authors"

**Source says:** "16 contributors"

**Fix:** Change "12" to "16"
