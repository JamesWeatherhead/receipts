# 🧾 reciepts

Show me the receipts on your citations.

Run `/reciepts:help` for commands.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup**: Put manuscript + source PDFs in a folder
2. **Init**: `/reciepts:init my_paper`
3. **Verify**: `/reciepts:verify my_paper`
4. **Report**: `/reciepts:report my_paper`

## What This Does

Verifies your citations actually say what you claim they say.

- ✓ VALID - Source supports your claim
- ⚠️ ADJUST - Minor discrepancy to fix
- ✗ INVALID - Source doesn't support claim
- ? UNCLEAR - Can't verify

*"Because Reviewer 2 will find out anyway."*
